	<p>* may have a 'w' at the beginning (or just starts with a vowel). This is because of an ambiguity in Pig Latin. 'wart' and 'art' translated into Pig Latin are both 'art-way'. Meaning if a human saw the Pig Latin word 'art-way,' the only way to decide whether it's 'wart' or 'art' is context. I think it's easier to disregard the asterix from words that just start with a vowel than to intuitively know to add a 'w' to words that originally had one.</p>
